Disease Detection using Machine Learningâ€ƒ
Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Developed a deep learning model to detect diseases from medical images with 95% accuracy.

Implemented image preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.

Trained and evaluated the model using TensorFlow/Keras with visualization of accuracy and loss metrics.

Designed the system to be adaptable for multiple disease categories and different image datasets.
